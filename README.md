##website name: Vintage Rider
###
On this site, I implemented login authentication using firebase (Google, Facebook login).
From this site, a user can get described ride (bike, car, bus, train) and may book the ticket within the date.
The blog post section will contain the latest traffic situations and the availability of the vehicle. In further, it would be used globally.
